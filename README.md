2/16/2015 update:

  the database is added, the user can login, search, post, edit post, go to profile and edit porfile
  
  the message system has not been implemented (socket.io may be a choice because it allows realtime chat without refreshing the pages like what we are doing when posting a item) (may need to create a seperate database to hold the history message) 
  
  due to the absent of message system, the verification system can not be implemented yet (because it need to send a verification message through the message system). so the verification questions have been set but not been used (they are stored in the found-galllery database, and are set by the users who post the threads). now the user just simiply jump to see the profile without answering verification question
