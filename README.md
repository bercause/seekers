2/16/2015 update:

  the database is added, the user can login, search, post, edit post, go to profile and edit porfile
  
  the message system has not been implement (socket.io may be a choice because it allows realtime chat without refreshing the pages like what we are doing when posting a item) (may need to create a seperate database to hold the history message) 
  due to the absent of message system, the verification system can not be implement yet (because it to send a verification message through the message system). so the verification question has been set but not been used (it is stored in the found-galllery database, and is set by the user who post this thread). now the user just simiply jump to see the profile without answering verification question
